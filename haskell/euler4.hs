{-
Largest palindrome product
Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

isPalindrome :: Integer -> Bool
isPalindrome n = n == reversed n

{- One easy improvement

If P is palindromic then:
P=100000x+10000y+1000z+100z+10y+x
P=100001x+10010y+1100z
P=11(9091x+910y+100z)
So one of the factors must be divisible by 11
