"""Problem 47
04 July 2003

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors
are:

14 = 2  7
15 = 3  5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime
factors are:

644 = 2Â²  7  23
645 = 3  5  43
646 = 2  17  19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct primes
factors. What is the first of these numbers?
