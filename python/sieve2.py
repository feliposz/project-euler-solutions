##To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n
##by Eratosthenes' method:
##Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
##Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
##Starting from p, count up in increments of p and mark each of these
##numbers greater than p itself in the list. These numbers will be
##2p, 3p, 4p, etc.; note that some of them may have already been marked.
##Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked.
##If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this
##number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
##When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are
##not marked are prime.
